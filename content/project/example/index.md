title: Artificial Intelligence Course Project
summary: This is the project for the artificial intelligence course, where we need to implement chess piece detection, use game search algorithms to implement the Gobang, then change  the game determination function to artificial neural networks and use evolutionary computation algorithms for model learning, and then use reinforcement learning for model learning.

An artificial intelligence approach is used to solve the gobang game problem with the following requirements.
-  Identify the current position of a piece during a gobang game by taking a picture, and the identification procedure should use supervised learning algorithms.
- A game search algorithm is used to implement the gobang game, in which the state of the game is judged by means of a human-set function.
- The function to determine the game state in the above game search algorithm is changed to an artificial neural network model. This artificial neural network model is learned using evolutionary computational methods, which allows the program to improve its chess playing level.
- The artificial neural network model described above is learned using reinforcement learning algorithms, which allows the program to play chess at an increasing level.
